# Affairs-Count-Prediction-App
This App predicts the number of Affairs from the personal, occupational &amp; other relevant data using Random Forest Regressor.

# Introduction
We have a dataset that contains information about people who were caught having affairs. It states some of the characteristics of these peple that
includes their occupation, family information and more.

We will be using this dataset to predict the number of affairs a person can have.

# Machine Learning Model
We start off with building machine learning model - we use a Random Forest Regressor model and train that model using the Affair datapoints.
One thing to note here is this dataset will require more feature building and extraction than exploratory analysis.
